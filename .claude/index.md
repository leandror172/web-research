### Indexing Conventions (Two-Tier System)

| Tier | Notation | When to Use | Lookup Method |
|------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Active reference** | `<!-- ref:KEY -->` + `[ref:KEY]` | Agent needs this during work; CLAUDE.md rules point here | `.claude/tools/ref-lookup.sh KEY` (machine-lookupable) |
| **Navigation pointer** | `§ "Heading"` | Index/docs pointing to sections for background reading | Open file, find heading (human/agent reads) |

**Active refs** are for high-frequency, runtime lookups.
**§ pointers** are for low-frequency, "read when needed" navigation.

**Single-responsibility rule:** One ref block per concept — don't wrap an entire file in one block.
Keep blocks narrow enough that `ref-lookup.sh KEY` returns only what's needed for the task.
